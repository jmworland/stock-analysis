# VBA Multi-Stock Analysis

##**Overview**
We were approached by a client that was doing some stock analysis for their parents. Initially it was focused on one particular stock that the parents had an emotional connection with and then we broadened the analysis to several other stocks that lined up with the business characteristics the parents liked. Our client wanted quick and clear analysis of these 12 stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 that they could present to their parents to make informed investment decisions.  

##**Results**
We were able to produce the wanted analysis and provide clear information for the client and their parents to make informed investment decisions. While almost all stocks performed admirably in 2017, only two, ENPH and RUN, performed well in 2018. We recommend the client and their parents look into those companies to invest their money rather than the initial choice of DQ.

######Findings
Here you can see snapshots of the analysis for both years and how long it took the code to run. You can see that the code ran for less than a second for both years which is reasonable for this type of analysis.

##**Summary**(What advantages or disadvantages to refactoring code? 3pts How do the pros and cons apply to refactoring original VBA script? 3pts)
The potential advantages to refactoring code are numerous. The ability to shorten code needed to complete the same process makes your job quicker and easier which gives you the opportunity to do more jobs. Also, the ability to understand code enough to bring it to its simplest form to do a task shows actual understanding and mastery of the code.

The disadvantages are you really need to know what each bit of code is doing to know if it can be simplified and still do the task needed. This is a bit easier if you are working on your own code that you wrote from scratch, but it is harder to do when you are working on code that is partially written or not your own. 

######Pros and Cons vs Old Code
Pros of the new code vs the old code mostly has to do with the streamlined code of just the analysis of the two years worth of data where as the old code has added lines for the original analysis of just the stock DQ. The new code does run significantly faster, but I am surprised as it should be running virtually the same code, but I am guessing since there is more information in the old workbook to go through that causes it to run slower?
